Fortunately we can do some things to reach the 99.99% which is considered to be a very high rate. Some of these things can help you reaching this highs ratio. Choose a reliable host, not all the hosts are the same, some have better uptime records than others. Reducing image sizes, is another thing you can do, because the bigger the images are more time it will take to the browser display your site, what could time out and down parts of your site, so, try to compress the images as much as you can. Use web caching, because it can speed up the access of your users to your site, since the browser can keep many files saved for the next access. Use CDN instead of having your scripts locally, which can reduce the size of your site. These were just a few things to use in order to improve your website uptime, but there are many others')">Research</button>
